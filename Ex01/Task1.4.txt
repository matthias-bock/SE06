Among the network topologies we considered, which one

a) Is the most expensive to setup in terms of equipment costs?
    Fully connected network.
    Requires connections between all participants, which is costly since the number of connections grows as 2^n-1.

b) Has the highest (i.e., slowest) worst-case message delivery time?
    Line Network.
    In a worst case scenario, the signal has to travel from one end of the line to the other, visiting every host.
    In contrast to a bus network however, every participant has to process the packet and send it to its neighbor, adding additional delay.

c) Corresponds to a small home network, where all devices are directly connected to the main router?
    Star Network.
    All participants are connected to the central router.
