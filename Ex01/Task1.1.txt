The N exams can be devided between the M friends.
Each person can then search for the student with the highest grade in their portion of grades.
After each person found the student in their batch of exams, these M students can be compared to find the overall highest grade among all N exam sheets.
To skip the work of comparing the M grades at the end, the current highest graded student can be written to a whiteboard,
and each friend will change the Students name if they found someone with a higher grade.
