Among the network topologies we considered, which one

a) Is the most expensive to setup in terms of equipment costs?
    Fully connected network.
    Requires connections between all participants, which is costly since the number of connections grows rapidly with more participants.

b) Has the highest (i.e., slowest) worst-case message delivery time?
    Bus network.
    All participants share a single communication line.
    This means that only one node can transmit at a time.
    In a worst case scenario, a node can wait indefinitely to send data.

c) Corresponds to a small home network, where all devices are directly connected to the main router?
    Star Network.
    All participants are connected to the central router.
